# Christmas Game 2021

Christmas is almost here and Santa is behind on his work building toys. Gather with a group of other friendly elves and listen to the Santa's story through his head elf, Larry. The emoji feedback you provide for Larry will help him make decisions and guide the course of Christmas. It's up to you to help Larry save Christmas for the children.

## Game Play

1. Player is presented with a textual gamebeat on Discord.
1. Player reacts to the game beat with a unicode emoji.
1. Game determines which unicode emoji was most common and provides the next game beat.

## Minimum Viable Product

This festive, holiday story will have three different emoji tracks:

1. Confident (ðŸ™‚ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜€)
1. Worried (ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤¨ðŸ˜Ÿ)
1. Frustrated (ðŸ˜–ðŸ˜¡ðŸ‘º)

Each gamebeat will have a track-themed version that will give a specific tone to the result. The character will be able to switch between tracks as they progress by choosing emojis on a separate track. There will be 5 gamebeats in the MVP in which Larry will guide the players around the North pole sharing his successes and failures.

The challenge is to empathize with Larry as he tries to help Santa save Christmas while still accepting and being honest with how they feel.

## Goals

In addition to the MVP we have a couple extra goals that could be achieved if there is time.

### Holiday Hidden Game Beats

On specific gamebeats if a holiday emoji is chosen (ðŸŽ„ðŸŽ…ðŸ¤¶) the players will be moved into a series of hidden game beats that extend and enhance the story. Hidden game beats follow the same tracks as the main story game beats. They will replace beats that are meant to be encountered when they are acheived.

### Additional Comedy Track

The holidays should be fun and funny! As Larry potentially bumbles and makes mistakes there's a good chance it will be funny. This new track will provide some comedy enhancements and maybe some flavorful dadjokes as Santa gets ready to deliver his gifts.
