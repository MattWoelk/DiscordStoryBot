```cargo run```

Goals:

- [x] basic story features
- [x] show options and associated text
- [x] images and other attachments
- [ ] emoji validation
- [ ] restart from the middle
- [ ] variables
- [ ] generate text from data, for example a health bar made of heart emojis. Maybe ink can do this without special code though, so we'll see.
- [ ] a way to show which options you would have had, but are unavailable, so people want to play again.
